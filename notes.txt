OOP
object oriented programming

-it is a programming paradigm that is centered around
objects rather than functions

-it is NOT a programming language or tool

-4 core concepts of OOP (pillars) (they are same in Python!!)
    1. Encapsulation
     -combine a group of related variables and functions into a 
 unit (object)
    -functions -> methods
    -variables -> properties
    -reduce complexity + increase reusability
    2. Abstraction
        -hiding some of the properties (like pressing play on vcr, you
        -don't know what happens internally when you press play, it just
        -plays, but there are functions that make it play)
        -simpler interface
        -reduces the impact of change

        - reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes
    3. Inheritance
    -mechanism that allows you to eliminate the outside code:
        -things like TextBox, Select, Checkbox
            -all have properties (like hidden and innerHTML)
            -all have methods (like click() and focus())
        -insead of defining each of these objects, we can have
        1 element that has properties and methods, and have 
        each of the objects inherit the objects properties and methods.
        -helps to eliminate redundant code

    4. Polymorphism
        -Poly = Many; Morph = Forms
        -technique that allows to get rid of long if and else or
        switch and case statements.
        -the way each element is rendered,
        you can define a render method that allows you to render()
        the object in different ways depening on the object it is 
        referencing. ex. element.render()
        -recactor ugly switch/case statements



objects


-Prototypes

-Portotypical Inheritance

-ES6 Classes (ECMAScript 6/2015)
    -ECMA is an organization that defines standards for technology
    -JavaScript is a  programming language that confirms the ECMA 
    script specifications

    ES6 - Classes (not like in C# or Java, they are syntatic sugar over
    prototypes and protypical inheritence)

-Modules
